### This repository contains the assignments for the class Object Oriented Programming. This class is part of the Software Development course at South West Technical College. 

###### Hello, my name is Karaline and I am currently taking the Software Development course. I started getting interested in coding around the beginning of high school. I took a few coding classes and really enjoyed them, so I wanted to learn more once I graduated. I have learned how to code in HTML and I am currently learning to code in Java. 

###### I am taking this program because I want to learn how to code in languages that will be the most helpful for a future career in computer programming. Not only is this class teaching me coding, but I am also learning skills that will help me to better manage my code and give me experience with creating my own projects that I can show to future employers.
